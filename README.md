# botometer_scores
The file includes the list of Twitter users that were evaluated by Botometer in the period between 2017 and 2020 and scored at least 0.5. These are used in the article published in the American Journal of Public Health: https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305902

Note that any over-estimate of the number of bots in the dataset does not invalidated the conclusions of the article, which show that bots are responsible for a small proportion of the vaccine-related tweets that typical US Twitter users may have seen in the period 2017-2019.
